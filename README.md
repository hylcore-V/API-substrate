# Plasm Blockchain API

> This library has been deprecated. We will introduce a new and better version soon!



Plasm API is a collection of TypeScript packages that aims to support blockchain application developers using Plasm Network and Substrate.

This repository is still under heavy development.
At the moment, we only offer `@astar-network/types` for client app development using `@polkadot/api`.
